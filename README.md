## Console Minesweeper Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game running in the console.

- Players choose the size of the minefield.
- Mines are randomly placed on the board (~30% of the field).
- Two modes available:
  - Hidden Mode: The board is masked; players uncover cells and get hints about adjacent mines.
  - Open Mode: The full board with mines is shown.
- Players gain points for uncovering safe cells.
- The game ends when a player uncovers a mine (loss) or safely uncovers all non-mine cells (win).
- Includes input validation and replay options.
